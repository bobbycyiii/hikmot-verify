# HIKMOT

Python3 port of HIKMOT, a SnapPy extension for verifying hyperbolic structures using interval arithmetic and the Krawczyk test, as explained in the paper [Verified computations for hyperbolic 3-manifolds](https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2015.1029599) by Neil Hoffman, Kazuhiro Ichihara, Masahide Kashiwagi, Hidetoshi Masai, Shin'ichi Oishi, and Akitoshi Takayasu.

As of 2020-07-24, HIKMOT still verifies all manifolds in `snappy.OrientableCuspedCensus`.
It also verifies the manifolds in `ClosedManifolds.zip`.
Just follow the instructions at the [HIKMOT website](http://www.oishi.info.waseda.ac.jp/~takayasu/hikmot/).
