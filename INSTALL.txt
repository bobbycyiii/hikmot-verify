Installation:

This package requires you to install a few things if you starting from scratch. Right now the guide will give instructions for 
mac and linux. If you are running windows, we have an instruction for Windows below (we gratefully acknowledge Mark Bell compiling these).

As noted on http://www.oishi.info.waseda.ac.jp/~takayasu/hikmot/, this package requires python2.7, Snappy, and boost.
We will now try to give step by step instructions for how to install this. Skip any steps you might have already done.

1) Are you using a mac?
If yes, then a) do you have developer tools installed? 
If not then go to: 
	https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#
and register for a free apple ID. Then download the appropriate version. At the time of writing,
it should be version 4.6.2 with Mountain lion (10.8+) and 3.2.2 with Snow Leopard (10.6).

2) Install python2.7 from python.org.
There is a stripped down version of python that Apple distributes. Users experience trouble installing 
snappy with the apple version so the version from python.org is preferred. 

3) Install Snappy as a python module. We can't say it better than the instructions given here:
	http://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/SnapPy/installing.html

4) Install boost using either

For Unbuntu: 
	sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

For macs (with ports installed): 
	sudo port install boost

And check that your path variable knows were boost is:
if you haven't done anything fancy

echo $PATH 

should have probably /opt/local/bin/boost (for macs using ports) or /usr/lib/boost (for linux)

If not, you need to update your PATH variable:

	PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin/boost    (macs) or 
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/boost         (linux)

5) Download hikmot in zip or tar.gz format from
	http://www.oishi.info.waseda.ac.jp/~takayasu/hikmot/#downloads

6) Inside the hikmot directory type:
	sudo python setup.py install



Instructions for Windows (we gratefully acknowledge Mark Bell compiling these)
           
                                                                                                                
Install Python:
	Download and run the Python2.7 installer: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7/python-2.7.msi
	Add the Python directory (C:\Python27) to the PATH environment variable.

Install setup_tools:
	Download and run ez_install: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py

Install snappy: 
	open command prompt and run
	python -m easy_install -U -f http://snappy.computop.org/get snappy

Install missing dlls:
	Download and run dependency walker: http://www.dependencywalker.com/
	Open C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\snappy-1.5.1-py2.7-win32.egg\snappy\SnapPy.pyd in dependency walker
	Download any missing dll files and copy them to C:\windows\System32

Test snappy:
	open command prompt and run:
	python
	import snappy

Install MSVC9.0:
	Download and install Visual C++ 2008 express edition: go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729279

Install boost:
	Download boost: http://www.boost.org/users/download/#live
	Unzip boost_1_54_0.zip to directory X

Install hikmot:
	Download hikmot: http://www.oishi.info.waseda.ac.jp/~takayasu/hikmot/
	Unzip hikmot_v0.0.7.zip to directory Y
	Change the include_dirs list in .\path\to\directory\Y\setup.py to "['cpp_src', 'path\\to\\directory\\X'],"
	open command prompt and run:
	cd .\path\to\directory\Y
	python setup.py install

Test hikmot:
	open command prompt and run:
	python
	import snappy
	import hikmot
	M = snappy.Manifold('4_1')
	hikmot.verify_hyperbolicity(M, False)
	
	Should return >>> (True, ...)

This was tested on a machine with the following installation:
Python 2.7
setuptools 1.1.6
SnapPy 2.0
MSCV 2008
boost 1.54.0  




If all goes well now you have it installed! 

In python we can use hikmot as follows:

>>>import snappy
>>>import hikmot 
>>>M = snappy.Manifold('m004')
>>>hikmot.verify_hyperbolicity(M,True)

This will return "OK" for any valid triangulation of a hyperbolic manifold and "False" otherwise. 
The flag "True" turns on verbose reporting of the check_hyp function. For verifying large sets of
 manifolds, such as a census, it is recommended this flag be set to "False".

That's it! We just showed the mainfold 'm004', aka the figure 8 knot complement, is hyperbolic.

The code to verify the whole cusped census is here:
http://www.oishi.info.waseda.ac.jp/~takayasu/hikmot/Codes/VerifyCuspedCensus.py

And the closed census is here:
http://www.oishi.info.waseda.ac.jp/~takayasu/hikmot/Codes/VerifyClosedManifolds.py
And more information on the subtleties of these techniques are explained here:

FAQ Mac:

************************************************************************************

Q: How do I check my python and gcc versions?

A: To find out what version of python and gcc you have, one of the easiest ways is to type "python" into the command line.

Here is a sample:
$ python
Python 2.7.4 (v2.7.4:026ee0057e2d, Apr  6 2013, 11:43:10) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin

So in this example, the computer is running python 2.7.4 and gcc 4.2.1. You can update your python
from python.org and update the latest gcc using ports:

/opt/local/bin/port install gcc_select
port select --list gcc
sudo port select --set gcc gcc**** (here you want to chooe the correct version.) 

************************************************************************************

Q: How do install ports?

A: You can see instructions for MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/install.php


************************************************************************************

Q: It seems like my python is up to date, but it still doesn't work. Any suggestions?

A: Macs sometimes have a version of python loaded from apple. Try downloading python2.7 (or higher) from
python.org. It tends to behave better with snappy.

************************************************************************************

Q: /usr/include/ does not have python2.7 as a folder.

(Warning this could be dangerous, so proceed with caution.)
A: One way to fix this is to update your xCode which requires updating to 10.7. If this is not an option,
try looking for /Applications/sage/local/include/python2.7 and copying the files from there to /usr/include/python2.7
